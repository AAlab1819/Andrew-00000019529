  # Week9-Shortest Path

## Dijkstra? - 20C

In this problem we have to find the cheapest path using Dijkstra. 

Note: Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm can be used to determine the shortest(cheapest in this case) path from one node in a graph to every other node within the same graph data structure, provided that the nodes are reachable from the starting node.

So we don't have to worry if the path is longer as long as the get the least cost.

Example:

| Source  | Destination | Cost | 
| --------| ----------- |----- |
| 1  | 2 | 2 |
| 2  | 5 | 5 |
| 2  | 3 | 4 |
| 1  | 4 | 1 |
| 4  | 3 | 3 |
| 3  | 5 | 1 |
